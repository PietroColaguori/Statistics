        <h2>Theory</h2>
        <h3>Question 1</h3>
        <p class="question">What is Statistics and its relationship with other disciplines. Difference between Descriptive and Inferential Statistics.</p>
        <p class="answer">
            Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. Statistics can be used to describe, summarize, compare, and make predictions based on data. Statistics can also help us test hypotheses and draw conclusions about various phenomena in the natural and social sciences.

Statistics has many applications and interactions with other disciplines, such as economics, business, planning, state administration, physical and natural sciences, social sciences, and more. Statistics can help us understand the patterns, trends, relationships, and effects of various factors in these fields. For example, statistics can help us measure the economic growth of a country, the effectiveness of a new drug, the impact of climate change, the preferences of consumers, the quality of education, and so on.

There are two main types of statistics: descriptive and inferential. Descriptive statistics use summary statistics, graphs, and tables to describe a data set. Descriptive statistics are useful because they allow us to understand a group of data much more quickly and easily compared to just looking at raw data values. For example, descriptive statistics can tell us the average, median, range, standard deviation, frequency distribution, and shape of a data set.

Inferential statistics use data from a sample to make predictions or generalizations about a larger population. Inferential statistics are useful because they allow us to draw conclusions and make decisions based on data that may not be available or feasible to collect for the entire population. For example, inferential statistics can help us estimate the proportion of voters who support a candidate, the mean difference between two groups in an experiment, the correlation between two variables in a survey, and so on.
